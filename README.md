## Introduction
This purpose of this project is to assess the impact of weather conditions on air quality.

### What is air quality?

Air quality is a measure of how clean or polluted the air is. 

### What is PM2.5?
Particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5 ), refers to tiny particles or droplets in the air that are 2 1/2 microns or less in width. Like inches, meters and miles, a micron is a unit of measurement for distance. It is a mixture of solid and liquid particles that are suspended in the air. These are categorized into coarse, fine and ultrafine. These particles usually come from cars, trucks, buses and off-road vehicle (e.g., construction equipment, snowmobile, locomotive) exhausts, and other operations that involve the burning of fuels such as wood, heating oil or coal and natural sources such as forest and grass fires. 

$$ Statement Problem
1. What weather factors greatly influence the PM 2.5 value?
2. Which month and year recorded the highest and lowest PM 2.5 value?
3. What is the forecast projection of the pm2.5 value in the next 4 years?
